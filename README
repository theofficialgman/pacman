Pacman
------

This is a clone of the original pacman_sdl from Namco, as I remember , and I played 
for the first time on an Atari 130 XL in the early 90s.
But Paul Neaves pacman_sdl clone has inspired me greatly.
One of the main goals of this implementation is a SDL Application with very
less use of CPU power.
