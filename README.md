Pacman
======

![in-game screenshot](https://libregamewiki.org/images/1/18/Pacman.png "in-game screenshot")

This is a clone of the original pacman_sdl by Namco, as I remember, that I played for the first time on an Atari 130 XL in the early 90s.

Also, Paul Neave's pacman_sdl clone has inspired me greatly.

One of the main goals of this implementation is an SDL application with a very low CPU usage.


## Install hint ##

You have to compile the Linux version on your own. For this, you'll need
* libsdl2
* sdl2-image
* sdl2-ttf
* and sdl2-mixer.

(make sure to take the devel packages) 
Then, download and extract the zip file or clone the pacman_sdl repository.
Inside the pacman_sdl directory, run
```
./configure
make
make install
```
For more detailed instructions, you may also have a look at the [INSTALL](https://github.com/ebuc99/pacman_sdl/blob/master/INSTALL) file.

After a successful installation, you should be able to start the game via command line: `pacman_sdl`

## Install Fedora ##

```
sudo dnf install make gcc-c++ SDL2 SDL2-devel SDL2_image SDL2_image-devel SDL2_mixer SDL2_mixer-devel SDL2_ttf SDL2_ttf-devel
```
Then, download and extract the zip file or clone the pacman_sdl repository.
Inside the pacman_sdl directory, run
```
